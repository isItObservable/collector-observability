## Episode : OpenTelemetry Collector Observability
This repository contains the files utilized during the tutorial presented in the dedicated IsItObservable episode related to the Observability of your OpenTelemetry Collectors.
this tutorial will also utilize the OpenTelemetry Operator with:
* the OpenTelemetry Demo
* the hipster-shop
* nginx ingress controller

* All the observability data generated by the environment would be sent to Dynatrace.

## Prerequisite
The following tools need to be install on your machine :
- jq
- kubectl
- git
- gcloud ( if you are using GKE)
- Helm


### 1.Create a Google Cloud Platform Project
```shell
PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com \
cloudtrace.googleapis.com \
clouddebugger.googleapis.com \
cloudprofiler.googleapis.com \
--project ${PROJECT_ID}
```
### 2.Create a GKE cluster
```shell
ZONE=europe-west3-a
NAME=isitobservable-collector-observability
gcloud container clusters create ${NAME} --zone=${ZONE} --machine-type=e2-standard-4 --num-nodes=2
```


### 3. Clone Github repo

```shell
git clone  https://github.com/isitobservable/collector-observability
cd collector-observability
```



## Getting started


### Dynatrace Tenant
#### 1. Dynatrace Tenant - start a trial
If you don't have any Dynatrace tenant , then I suggest to create a trial using the following link : [Dynatrace Trial](https://dt-url.net/observable-trial)
Once you have your Tenant save the Dynatrace tenant url in the variable `DT_TENANT_URL` (for example : https://dedededfrf.live.dynatrace.com)
```
DT_TENANT_URL=<YOUR TENANT Host>
```

##### 2. Create the Dynatrace API Tokens
The dynatrace operator will require to have several tokens:
* Token to deploy and configure the various components
* Token to ingest metrics and Traces


###### Operator Token
One for the operator having the following scope:
* Create ActiveGate tokens
* Read entities
* Read Settings
* Write Settings
* Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
* Read configuration
* Write configuration
* Paas integration - installer downloader
<p align="center"><img src="/image/operator_token.png" width="40%" alt="operator token" /></p>

Save the value of the token . We will use it later to store in a k8S secret
```shell
API_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN VALUE>
```
###### Ingest data token
Create a Dynatrace token with the following scope:
* Ingest metrics (metrics.ingest)
* Ingest logs (logs.ingest)
* Ingest events (events.ingest)
* Ingest OpenTelemetry
* Read metrics
<p align="center"><img src="/image/data_ingest_token.png" width="40%" alt="data token" /></p>
Save the value of the token . We will use it later to store in a k8S secret

```shell
DATA_INGEST_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN VALUE>
```


### Deploy most of the components 
The application will deploy the entire environment:
```shell
chmod 777 deployment.sh
./deployment.sh  --clustername "${NAME}" --dturl "${DT_TENANT_URL}" --dtingesttoken "${DATA_INGEST_TOKEN}" --dtoperatortoken "${API_TOKEN}" 
```

## Tutorial Steps

### Collector Dashboard

Let's deploy the dashboard located : `dynatrace/OpenTelemtry Collector.json`

In dynatrace , Open The Dashboard application and click on upload
<p align="center"><img src="/image/collector_dashboard.png" width="40%" alt="Collector dashboard" /></p>

This dashboard will keep track on the health of your collector:
- ressource usage
- GC 
- pipeline health

### The Collector Traces
Now let's have a look at the traces produced by the collector

You can open your Dynatrace Tenant, and open The `Services` application , you should find a dedicated service for our OpenTelemetry Collector

<p align="center"><img src="/image/services.png" width="70%" alt="collector" /></p>

And if you open this service you will find all the various traces produced by the collector:

<p align="center"><img src="/image/collector_service.png" width="70%" alt="collector_service" /></p>

You can select one of the distributes traces available in this screen you will see the trace produced by the exporter :
